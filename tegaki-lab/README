tegaki-lab
===========

Placeholder for experiments with new recognition engines.

/!\ This package is for developers only. Simple users don't need it.

Requirements
------------

Python       2.4    http://www.python.org
GHMM *       SVN    http://ghmm.sourceforge.net
tegaki       0.1
tegaki-gtk   0.1

[*] The Python bindings are also required.

Adding more training-data
-------------------------

Let's say we want to add training data for latin characters. The folder
structure is as follows.

data/eval/[corpus_name]/[set_name]/*.xml
data/train/[corpus_name]/[set_name]/*.xml

[corpus-name] and [set_name] can be pretty much whatever you like but it's
better to follow some kind of convention.

In case we have handwriting data for two different persons, we use
"latin-writer1" and "latin-writer2" as corpus folder names.

If each person writes three times each character, we could use "s1", "s2"
and "s3" as set folder names.

*.xml files are of the form char_code.xml where char_code is a the
unicode number of the character. For example, the file for "a" would be 97.xml.

To create the handwriting data, you can use the character editor. For example:

$ mkdir -p data/train/latin-writer1/s1
$ ./character-editor data/train/latin-writer1/s1 \
a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m,n,o,p,q,r,s,t,u,v,w,x,y,z

Adding a new model
------------------

Let's say we want to create a new model called basic_latin.

1) mkdir models/basic_latin
2) cp models/basic/__init__.py models/basic_latin/
3) Create a file models/basic_latin/model.py. The minimalist code is:

import os
from tegaki.arrayutils import *
import models.basic.model

class Model(models.basic.model.Model):

    def __init__(self, *args):
        models.basic.model.Model.__init__(self, *args)
        self.CORPORA = ["latin-writer1", "latin_writer2"]
        self.ROOT = os.path.join("models", "basic_latin")
        self.update_folder_paths()

4) To run through all the steps, run: ./mmanager basic_latin all

Run ./mmanager without arguments to see the help.

5) Have a look at models/basic/model.py to see what parameters and methods
   you can override. Change whatever you like to improve the accuracy.

6) Try with your own handwriting with:

./mmanager basic_latin pad

The above may yield strange results due to a bug in either pygtk or ghmm. In
that case, try:

./mmanager pad | ./mmanager basic_latin eval -s

The results appear in the console.
