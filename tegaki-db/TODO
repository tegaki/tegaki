Folder structure
================

bin/                for command-line tools (e.g. dictionary compiler, db export)
data/www/           for public media files
tegakidb/           for the website source
templates/html/     for the HTML templates

Database structure
==================

Since we are potentially dealing with lots of data, data structures should be
designed to be very performant.

User
----

user_id: Integer Key
name: String (max 30, alphanumeric only)
n_handwriting_samples: Integer (Default: 0)
description: Text

UserPermissions
---------------
user_id: Foreign Key
can_access: Boolean (Default: True)
can_edit: Boolean (Default: False)
can_proofread: Boolean (Default: False)
can_access_admin: Boolean (Default: False)

UserSensitiveInfo
-----------------

user_id: Foreign Key

[Notes]

character_sets: a comma-separated list of character_set_id. Only characters
from those sets will be asked to the user.

dictionaries: a comma-separated list of dictionary_id. It will be attempted to
find characters in thoses dictionaries to display definitions below the
character asked.

CharacterSet
------------

character_set_id: Integer Key
name: String (max 30)
lang: String (max 10)
description: String (max 255)
characters: TEXT

[Notes]

characters: the characters in the set can be defined by lists of character codes
and/or code ranges. Codes are unicode. E.g.

20..30, 34, 35, 40...45, 48

20..30 means from 20 to 30 included.
40...45 means from 40 to 45 excluded.

lang: a language code as defined in
http://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry.

The preferred lang codes will be:
- ja: Japanese
- ko: Korean
- zh-Hans: Simplified Chinese
- zh-Hant: Traditional Chinese

Other zh-* tags may be used for very specific Chinese characters.

[Example]

name: ASCII characters
lang: en
description: characters in US-ASCII
characters: 0..255

Character
---------

[Notes]

data: the XML output of a Character object. Some parameters will be both in the
XML data and in the table fields.
- When data is submitted, the table fields must be updated to be the same as in
the XML.
- When XML is generated from the database, the fields in the XML must be
updated with the fields from the database.

Because the XML received can't be trusted, it should be checked for consistency:
- well-formed XML
- correct types at the right location (e.g. x and y should be Integers)

model: a handwriting sample of good quality can be set to True and will be used
by the system as a model.

proofread_by: comma-separated string of user_id.

client: which client used (e.g. tegaki-gtk, webcanvas)

----------

dictionary_id: Integer Key
name: String (max 30)
description: String (max 255)
lang: String (max 10)

DictionaryEntry
---------------

[Notes]

definition: may context simple HTML tags

Pages
=====

About page
----------

- password [mandatory]
- email [optional]

- Characters sets (at least one)
- Dictionaries (zero or more)
- User Level for ja, ko, zh-Hans, zh-Hant (at least one not set to None)

Implement a simple system to prevent massive creation of accounts (should be
accessible).

Password lost
-------------

Change password by reassigning a new one. Not possible if email not provided.

[Clear | Revert Stroke | Send!]

--------------------------------------------------

Note1: Display the about message on the index only if the user is not logged in
Note2: When the "Send!" button is clicked, AJAX should be used to minimize the
bandwidth required to transfer the data.
Note3: If the user is not logged in and click on the send button, redirect to
log in page!

C: The character to be written by the user. What character is to be displayed
next is to be determined by an algorithm.

dictionary definition: E.g. English translation + reading (pinyin or hiragana).
Since a character may have more than one definition attached to it, the
definition must be chosen at random.

User profile
------------

- Name
- Number of contributed characters
- Description
- List of last handwriting samples contributed [Click to see the handwriting
sample]

Handwriting sample page
-----------------------

- Character in utf8
- Lang
- Author
- Webcanvas (in locked mode, i.e. it is not possible to edit the character)

This page is not visible if the user has set show_handwriting_samples to False.

Classification page
-------------------

The purpose of the classification is to determine the values for:
- stroke_order_incorrect
- wrong_stroke
- wrong_spacing

using human's proofreading.

For each of those three fields, the proofreader will have to choose between
True or False using a radio button. To help in this process, stroke order
images will be displayed.

If a handwriting sample with model=True is available, display the stroke order
image (using the PNG writing renderer) for both the model and the handwriting
sample to classify. This will help the proofreader to compare the handwriting
sample with the model.

Otherwise, only display the stroke order image for the handwriting sample to
classify.

For stroke_number_incorrect, human interaction is not necessary because we can
use a file with a mapping "unicode -> stroke number" to do that automatically.

One character at a time is displayed on the classification page. Use AJAX to
load the next handwriting sample to classify.

Which handwriting sample to classify next?
- n_proofread < 3
- handwriting samples with smaller n_proofread classified first

Increment n_handwriting_samples in the User and Character tables. Increment
n_correct_handwriting_samples in Character table if the handwriting sample is
correct. A handwriting sample is correct if all stroke_order_incorrect,
stroke_number_incorrect, wrong_stroke and wrong_spacing values are set to False.

Only people with can_proofread permission can classify handwriting samples.

Additionally, a RSS feed (protected by authentication) could be used to check
when new characters with n_proofread=0 need to be classified.

Handwriting samples browse
--------------------------

People with the required permission can browse and search for handwriting
samples in the database.

Statistics
----------

- Best contributors
- Number of handwriting samples for each character

News
----

Latest annoncements. News can be edited in the administration by users with
can_edit to True.

Session
=======

A number of information, most importantly from UserPreferences should be kept in
the session.

Next character to display
=========================

The next character to display to the user on the main page should match the
following criteria:
- should be in the character sets chosen by the user
- should be the character with the smallest number of correct samples available

The rationale for that is to have a balanced number of handwriting samples for
each character.

Internationalization
====================

The default language of the interface should be English but it should be
possible to translate the interface into other languages.

Export
======

In production mode, the server should use MySQL or PostgreSQL but it should be
possible to export all tables, with the exception of UserSensitiveInfo, to a
SQLite database using a tool placed in bin/.

The database API should be usable from other applications. For example, SQLite
databases will be used by tegaki-models.

Unit tests
==========

Test the website with unit tests! :)

XML-RPC webservice
==================

Some functions should be exported over XML-RPC. For example:

client(name) -> True if succeeded # For the client to identify itself to the
                                  # webservice

authenticate(login, password) -> A SHA-256 session id if succeeded or False.

send_character(sessionid, xml, compressed) -> True if succeeded

The XML-RPC will be used by a pygtk client (which will use the canvas in
libtegaki-gtk). Other possible clients include a Facebook application.
